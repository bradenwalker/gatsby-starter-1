    <h1>Plot Synopsis</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You -- Apprentice and wizard. Apprentice tells wizard he’s ready to perform magic. Wizard says, “Again? Ok, show me. But if you’re wrong you’re copying spells.” Apprentice fails, back to copying spells.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wizard and apprentice shopping at bazaar. “I can’t do magic because you won’t teach me!” says apprentice. Wizard snaps back angrily. Apprentice is hurt, angry. As wizard is distracted, shady merchant tells apprentice he can sell him “real magic” (an item that provides a shortcut.)
      </li>
      <li>
        As apprentice takes item, wizard shouts, “Noooo!” Item is cursed. A demonic familiar pops out. Wizard tries to undo deal. Merchant says “I need a soul.” Wizard agrees to take apprentice’s place. Apprentice: NO! Wizard and merchant vanish. (As he’s vanishing, Wizard leaves clue for apprentice to rescue them that pays off later.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Apprentice learns what familiar can do. They practice finding/teleportation magic.
      </li>
      <li>
        They successfully cast the spell, warping them to the merchant’s hideout.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wizard is imprisoned. Merchant (actually much more evil / powerful than initially thought, or the merchant is simply a middleman acting on the behalf of a much more powerful being) kicks the apprentice’s ass. Curses apprentice and familiar with immunity to magic, and turns apprentice into a goblin like the familiar. Both are warped to no man’s land. They fight, split up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wandering the desert, they come upon a caravan. It’s recruiting mercenaries to enlist in the sword city guard. The city is under attack and needs defenders. They join up, begrudgingly reconcile and make their way back to the city. Maybe one joins up (female main character) and is surprised to see that other goblins have joined, including her former familiar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Making their way back to the city, they see that the Big Bad is attacking. Dodging life-threatening obstacles, they are attacked by the big bad and discover that -- suprise -- not only can the protag not cast magic, she is also *immune* to magic! She stops the Big Bad in a public display. Seeing her efforts, the head of the guard asks her and her familiar to become permanent guards. Maybe the Big Bad opened a hellmouth and the city anticipates more monsters of the week coming through.
